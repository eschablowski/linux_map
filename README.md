# Linux Map (WIP)

A small, lightweight (WIP), and offline map application and library for linux and abroad.

## Capabilities (All still in progress)

1. Interplanetary Travel
2. Command line interface (Route calculation and map interface only, since maps are impossible to correctly draw in ascii)
3. Terminal user interface (Allows for map display, although requiring a TTY shell and linux)
4. Graphical user interface
5. Multi-threaded and load-as-needed gives optimal space and time efficiency
